Fixed all the warnings

line 166 - why are you just appending index to any normal http request?
line 156 - not exactly an issue, just curious as to why you're dup2'ing the stdout and then the stderr (wouldn't this overwrite?)


When just opening root directory on the normally running server:
Appends index, works great
...
Handling request from 127.0.0.1:45563 "GET /favicon.ico HTTP/1.1"
pointer value is:/favicon.ico
/favicon.ico
...
Attempts to append index to favicon.ico
Aborts

Favicon is a standard http thing, but we never specified it, is there a way to handle this implicitly or should we just create a favicon to fit into the structure?

Second half is due to the appending outlined in line 166
